        <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish. </li>
        <li>In a small bowl combine the dates and baking soda. Pour enough boiling water over the dates to just cover them. </li>
        <li>Cream 1/3 cup of butter with the white sugar until light. Beat in the eggs and mix well to combine. </li>
        <li>Add the flour and date mixture (including water) to the egg mixture and fold to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a tester comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool slightly and prepare the sauce. </li>
        <li> To Make Caramel Sauce: In a small saucepan combine the brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and evaporated milk. Cook over medium heat and bring to boil. 
            Turn heat down and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. 
            Pour the sauce over individual servings of warm cake. </li>
