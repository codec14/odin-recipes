    <p>Chocolate chip cookies are a classic and easy-to-make snack that's loved by all.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br>
    <!-- ingredients list down below-->
    <ul>
        <li>Sugars: A blend of brown and white sugars create a perfectly sweet, warm flavor.</li>
        <li>Butter: A stick of butter adds richness, moisture, flavor, and tenderness.</li>
        <li>Egg: One whole egg acts as a binding agent, which means it helps hold the cookie dough together.</li>
        <li>Brandy: Instead of vanilla, these white chocolate cranberry cookies are flavored with brandy â€” it gives them a complex, boozy edge</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.</li>
        <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the dough rise</li>
        <li>White chocolate: Of course, you'll need white chocolate chips! White chocolate chunks will also work well.</li>
    </ul>
